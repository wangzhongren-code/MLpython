README.txt
This repository was established for some machine learning experiments with Python. 
Currently I've only pulled the source code of some models:
K-means Clustering
Linear Regression
Logistic Regression
...
And there are also some basic implementations of model selection skills and evaluation techniques such as
ROC curve 
Cross Validation
...
I've also made an animation to better exhibit the process of clustering.
Due to the limited capability of the author, there may be some mistakes.
And I am anticipating your criticism.
Hope it helps!
Thanks for coming!
